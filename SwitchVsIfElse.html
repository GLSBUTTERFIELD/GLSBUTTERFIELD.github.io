		<h1><strong><em>What is the difference between switch and if/else? When would you use one versus the other?</em></strong></h1>

<p>Both <strong>switch</strong> and <strong>if/else</strong> are conditional statements that execute code depending on whether the condition(s) is/are met.</p>

<p>The main difference between the two is that <strong>switch</strong> statements evaluate <em>one</em> variable (such as 'char,' 'string', etc.) while <strong>if/else</strong> statements can evaluate <em>multiple</em> variables, meaning you can require multiple conditions to be met with <strong>if/else</strong> statements.</p>

<p>I would use <strong>switch</strong> when I have one variable that can be evaluated against a specific set of answers, and I would use <strong>if/else</strong> when there are multiple variables or conditions to be met.</p>
